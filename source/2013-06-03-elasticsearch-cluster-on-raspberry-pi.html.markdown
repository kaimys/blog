A nice demo of Rashid Khan from Elasticsearch. He runs a 4 node cluster on with Raspberry Pis connected via Wifi.

A closer look. Status green but still no document indexed.

After a while there where 253 documents indexed and you can query the db from the desktop pc. Hopefully the video will be online soon.
